I believe that the nuclear industry poses two key possibilities for the future. One is as a low-carbon, large scale replacement for fossil fuel power plants. A shift away to a lower carbon emission power provision system is necessary to reduce the effect of human accelerated climate change, and nuclear provides a concurrent stream to renewable sources that should be explored to provide the growing energy needs for both the developed and the developing world.

Secondly it continues to provide a source of interesting and complex technical challenges to be solved for both further implementation of existing designs, development of new designs and the continued question of safe storage of radioactive waste components. Both the technical challenges and the public engagement necessary to overcome and acquire funding for these challenges provides a variety of opportunities and many possibilities to gain a variety of experience in a number of tasks.
