As part of my graduate studies I was tasked with assisting in finding the cause of and solution to a case of extreme heating in a fast pulsed ferrite kicker magnet in the LHC during normal operation. It was necessary to consider the conflicting requirements of beam operation (demanding high beam currents), kicker operation (requiring a fast rise time and field quality) and heat reduction (many solutions resulted in worsening kicker operation or reducing the beam current, counter to experimental requirements). 

A number of solutions were investigated, focusing on reducing the heat load whilst ensuring suitable magnet operation for the accelerator, however these often failed to meet electrical breakdown requirements. Discussion lead to proposing a mechanical change to the design which led to a dramatic reduction in electrical breakdown, but also in the heat load, which simulations confirmed in both requirements. This solution is subsequently to implemented in a number of new magnets for replacement of those currently in use.
