As a side project during my tenure at CERN myself and a number of colleagues (almost all graduate students or postdoctoral fellows), upon exploration of the service tunnels beneath CERN, collaborated to make an amateur horror film set at CERN. Using borrowed filming equipment, home made props and training ourselves in our own allotted tasks we created a 76 minute long zombie film entitled "Decay" (website www.decayfilm.com). Due to our minimal budget, locations shared with working spaces and otherwise busy work schedule we had to improvise many innovative solutions to shooting times and film design choices. 

I was responsible for stunt/fight choreography, prop/set design and assisted with make up, lighting and general assistance during shooting. Production took approximately 2 years, with the premiere being held on the 29th November at Manchester University. The film has subsequently received worldwide press coverage in multiple languages, both in the printed press and the online press.
