EMPLOYMENT ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Senior Research Fellow, CERN (European Centre for Particle Physics) (2013-07 — 2016-06)
Worked in the fast pulsed systems group of the technology department on various topics related to the LHC injection kicker magnets, focused on electromagnetic interactions between the particle beam and the electromagnet.
- Proposed upgrade to EM performance of magnet which was subsequently applied to all kicker magnets during 2013 maintenance shutdown.
- Lead study of HV behaviour of cathode triple junction as applied to LHC kicker magnet geometry.

Doctoral Student, CERN (European Centre for Particle Physics) (2010-02 — 2013-01)
Examining the electromagnetic interactions between charged particle beams and particle accelerator components using simulation suites and bench-top measurements techniques. Focused on normal-conducting fast pulsed electromagnets and collimators (robust beam protection equipment) necessitating dealing with competing design requirements to find optimal solutions.
- Lead simulation and measurement campaign of beam coupling impedance of the LHC injection magnets
- Devised an analysis technique to measure beam impedance in asymmetric structures
- Systematic study of impedance reduction techniques, their advantages/disadvantages and implementation
