I'm applying for the position of Sustainable Transport Analyst Consultant.

I have until recently worked as a senior research fellow at CERN, Switzerland. My role there concerned upgrades to fast pulsed systems, evaluating the feasibility of electromagnetic upgrades to the system whilst maintaining conflicting operational requirements of high voltage performance, high vacuum compatibility and machine protection. In this position I was required to evaluate proposed upgrades using simulation tools and bench-top measurements, in addition to evaluating possible new technologies that might improve device performance. Rapid assimilation of new information and rigorous evaluation of their viability was needed against stringent and varied criteria.

I'm applying for the above position as I find the challenges associated with it to exhilarating. Transport and sustainable energy is an area that greatly interests me, in particular the chance to work with it from various aspects. My professional experience and also my volunteer experience as a mentor at hackathons has given my extensive experience on approaching new areas, rapidly exploring and acquiring a practical knowledge of the subject and applying this in a robust way, and in a manner appropriate to the task and audience it's intended for, as this position would require.
