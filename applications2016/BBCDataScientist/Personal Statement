I have recently worked as an applied physicist, having recently completed a post-doctoral fellowship at CERN (the European Centre for Particle Physics) in the technology department. This has involved working on technically challenging physical problems on both the development of future equipment upgrades and problem solving of existing equipment in an international environment.

I'm keen to move into a less academic environment to find new challenges to take on and new skills to develop, building on my background of technical problem solving and numerical insights.

In my previous position I was required to propose performance upgrades to hardware, often requiring rapidly acquiring functional familiarity with new technologies and processes to ensure that they were compatible with the magnets operational parameters, which often required novel approaches due to conflicting requirements. I developed an approach of studying new processes and technologies, judging how to test them for suitability and designing and proceeding with the tests, which could be laboratory tests, computational simulations, or procedural tests of compatibility. This required a keen eye for details, and being able to spot relevant information within otherwise dense data.

As part of working in a collaborative environment, I developed a python library for the analysis of electromagnetics in particle accelerators, managed via git, and took to giving informal coaching to new members of staff on laboratory techniques, common simulation tools and other technical elements of their work.
