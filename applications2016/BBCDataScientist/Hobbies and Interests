I'm very active in STEM outreach. In the past I've helped organise Comedy Collider/LHComedy - a stand up comedy show at CERN where physicists performed alongside professional comedians (including Helen Arney and Lieven Scheire), Pint of Science CH, a set of science talks in pubs in Geneva and gave tours around CERN to visitors.
I spend a lot of time tinkering with electronics and hacking code, both to learn and produce new things. In particular I volunteer as a team mentor and general assistance for THE Port hackathon - a hackathon aimed at solving humanitarian problems. I'm also part of the CosmicPi team, aimed at making an open-source, cheap cosmic ray detector.
Asides from this I like mountain sports (climbing, skiing), running and historical reenactment.
