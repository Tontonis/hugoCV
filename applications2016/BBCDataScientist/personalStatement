My background as a physicist stems from my passion for exploring how the world works and why patterns we see form. Both in physical systems, and in patterns we see in technology and behaviour exploring data to see what patterns are evident, and more importantly why has been the driving curiosity in my career to date. Further exploring data as an input and contributor to decision making and awareness is where I would next like to take my career.

My previous employer has been the largest international scientific organisation in the world; collaborations with experts in universities and industry were part of daily work, as was working on cross-departmental projects and with multiple nationalities, often in multi-lingual environments where building professional relationships required being adaptive to very varying personalities.

I've had extensive experience in data analysis and representation using python (predominantly scipy, matplotlib and parts of scikit-learn), MATLAB and occasionally C, presenting the resulting to both specialist and general audiences. My involvement with the cosmicPi project has led me to learn package management and software development standards also, adding json and git to my skills as a software developer.

My background as a public science communicator lets me explain complex subjects at a level suitable to the audience, from in-depth technical experts to the general public.
