Reasons for Applying

The variety of technologies, techniques and areas that patent entries and applications interests me as it promises to provide varied and new areas to work to work with as part of the day to day job. My previous jobs have involved having to rapidly learn, understand and make use of new subjects in productive ways have lead to design choices of hardware being made from the results of these studies.

In addition the pattern of rigorous evaluation of patents and the working environment of the EPO, in particular a multi-lingual and diverse workplace focused on technical excellence is one that would be both fulfilling and one I could contribute too positively.
